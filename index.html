              <h2>The Evolution of Badminton</h2>
              <p>
                Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
                Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" 
                (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played
                as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. 
                Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

              <h2>The History of Badminton</h2>
              <p>
                Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,
                but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the 
                expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore 
                and shuttlecock. "Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".

              <h2>The Racquets of Badminton</h2>
              <p>
                Badminton racquets are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95 grams 
                (2.5 and 3.4 ounces) not including grip or strings.[14][15] They are composed of many different 
                materials ranging from carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic) to solid steel, 
                which may be augmented by a variety of materials.
